#Semantic Samantha

##About
Creating and keep track of progress towards measureable goals is hard!
This is why we have created Semantic Samantha to help you in achieving you goals!
When you give Samantha a goal, she will decide on three metrics that you will keep track of together.
Each day, you can then create a journal entry where you talk about your efforts.
She will handle all the evaluation for you.
At any time, you can chat with her about how your progress is going.
